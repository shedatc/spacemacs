;;; Commentary:
;; ExtendSMIME enhances DefaultEncrypt to support S/MIME.  Moreover, it allows
;; to retrieve certificates via LDAP and to import them into gpgsm.
;;
;; Preliminaries:
;; I use, but do not recommend, S/MIME.  I recommend GnuPG.
;; Here is what I think about the “trust” model of S/MIME:
;; https://blogs.fsfe.org/jens.lechtenboerger/2013/12/23/openpgp-and-smime/
;;
;; Functionality:
;; The general idea of ExtendSMIME is to enhance S/MIME support in Gnus for
;; * retrieval of certificates from LDAP servers with import into gpgsm
;;   (smime-cert-by-ldap-1 redefined, including a bug fix and negative
;;   caching) and
;; * (via jl-encrypt.el) automatic insertion of MML tags into messages if
;;   certificates for all recipients are available.
;;
;; Note that version 3 of ExtendSMIME introduces a major change: Previous
;; versions used openssl for cryptographic operations while version 3 uses
;; gpgsm (part of gnupg-2).  In particular, certificates are no longer
;; maintained by ExtendSMIME but are imported into gpgsm.  In fact, gpgsm
;; manages certificates on its own and automatically extracts certificates
;; from signed messages, which simplifies the code of ExtendSMIME a lot.
;;
;; The general idea of ExtendSMIME is to search for missing certificates via
;; LDAP before an e-mail is sent.  Resulting certificates are imported
;; into gpgsm.  LDAP search is customizable (and documented) via
;; `jl-smime-permit-ldap'.
;;
;; In addition to this automatic LDAP search, the command
;; `M-x jl-smime-key-available-p' allows manual searches.  It asks for an
;; e-mail address (an address at point is used as default value).  If no
;; certificate is available, an LDAP search is started (ignoring negative
;; caching and `jl-smime-permit-ldap').  If a certificate is found, it is
;; imported into gpgsm; otherwise, a negative cache entry is created.
;;
;; Documentation concerning S/MIME with GNU Emacs is mostly targeting openssl
;; but not gpgsm.  See installation instructions below.

;; Install:
;; Message security (as described in Info node `(message) Security')
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html
;; automatically prefers EasyPG with gpgsm over openssl if EasyPG is loaded
;; first.  Thus, place jl-smime.el as well as jl-encrypt.el into your
;; load-path, and add the following to ~/.emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'epa-file)
;;     (load "jl-smime")
;;
;; Optionally, but unrelated to e-mail, you may also want:
;;     (setq epa-file-encrypt-to "<your-key-id>")
;;     (setq epg-debug t)
;;
;; Customizable variables of ExtendSMIME are jl-smime-permit-ldap,
;; jl-smime-negative-cache-dir, and jl-smime-negcache-maxage.
;; You may want to read their documentation.
;;
;; I'm using the following code after (load "jl-smime") in my setup:
;;
;; ;; Allow automatic LDAP queries for certificates within my domain.
;; (setq jl-smime-permit-ldap "@\\(.+\\.\\)?uni-muenster\\.de$")
;;
;; ;; I'm searching for S/MIME certificates via LDAPS at DFN-Verein.
;; ;; Note that ldap.el in Emacs requires a minor workaround to perform
;; ;; encrypted connections via LDAPS.  In fact, ldapsearch is being invoked
;; ;; to use unencrypted plaintext LDAP communication with the parameter "-h".
;; ;; Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I only got LDAPS to work with the
;; ;; parameter "-H ldaps://ldap.pca.dfn.de".  To get rid of the default
;; ;; parameter -h, I'm passing the empty string as hostname, setting
;; ;; smime-ldap-host-list to '("").  Finally, ldapsearch aborts the
;; ;; connection if it is not told where to find the CA certificate for the
;; ;; LDAPS server (which is a Good Thing).
;; ;; I created ~/.ldaprc with a single line pointing to that CA certificate:
;; ;; TLS_CACERT /path/to/server/cert
;; (require 'ldap)
;; (setq smime-ldap-host-list '(""))
;; (setq ldap-default-base "O=DFN-Verein,C=DE"
;;       ; -x: no SASL authentication, -tt: store result in file
;;       ; -H: connect to specified URI.
;;       ldap-ldapsearch-args '("-x" "-tt" "-H ldaps://ldap.pca.dfn.de")
;;       )
;;
;; If you used openssl previously, you need to import your keys and
;; certificates into gpgsm.  Here are three-and-a-half steps, which worked for
;; me.
;;
;; First, import the private key.
;; $ gpgsm --import my-private-key.p12
;;
;; Second, the CA signing my certificate is unknown to gpgsm (gpg-agent, in
;; fact).  Thus, gpgsm refuses to use that key pair.  I added the option
;; `allow-mark-trusted' to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf.  Then I tried again to
;; sign a file.  This time, gpg-agent displayed the root CA's fingerprint and
;; asked whether I trust it.  Saying "yes" added that fingerprint to
;; ~/.gnupg/trustlist.txt, and the key became usable.  (Note that you must
;; “trust” the root CA; adding an intermediate CA's fingerprint does not work.
;; You read my article on “trust”, didn’t you?)
;;
;; Third, import (a subset of) your old certificates.  With ExtendSMIME before
;; version 3, those were stored in files under
;; `smime-certificate-directory', ~/Mail/certs, by default.  In that
;; directory, execute: $ gpgsm --import <certfiles>
;;
;; Finally, decide how you ensure that you can decrypt your own e-mails.
;; See comments for DefaultEncrypt in jl-encrypt.el and note that, similarly
;; to gpg, gpgsm understands the option "--encrypt-to" (which is not
;; mentioned in the man page).  I have the following line in gpgsm.conf:
;; encrypt-to <colon-separated-fingerprint-of-own-key>

;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.

  "Control whether LDAP queries should look for missing certificates.
If this variable is nil (the default), LDAP queries are only
performed by standard Gnus message behavior (with EasyPG probably
never).
Otherwise, this variable must be a regular expression matching
e-mail addresses.  Whenever an S/MIME certificate is missing for
an e-mail address that (a) matches this regular expression
and (b) is not recorded under `jl-smime-negative-cache-dir', an
LDAP query for a certificate is performed.
Note that such an LDAP query tells the LDAP server and (if you do
not use encrypted LDAPS communication) *every* party controlling
any node or link between you and that server to whom you are
about to send an e-mail.  Such information leakage may or may not
be tolerable in your situation.

At work I'm using \"@\\(.+\\.\\)?uni-muenster\\.de$\" to check for
certificates for all addresses under \"uni-muenster.de\".
Thus, if I send an e-mail to an address within my domain, and gpgsm
does not have a certificate for that address, an LDAP search is
started.  If that search returns a certificate, it is imported
into gpgsm.  If no certificate is found, a negative cache entry
for the e-mail address is created.  As long as that entry exists
\(see `jl-smime-negcache-maxage'), no further LDAP query will be
started for that address."
